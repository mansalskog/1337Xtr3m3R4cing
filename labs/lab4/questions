1. What kind of data does the heightmap image data hold? What range is the heightmap data?
8-bit RGB pixels that are grayscale. 0-255 is the range.

1. The terrain is 4x4. How many polygons does it draw?
3 * 3 squares = 3 * 3 * 2 triangles = 18 triangles

2. Did you need to extend your camera movement code? How?
Added mouse look.

3. Which method did you use to find the normal vector?
High precision version. With weighed average on angle. Edges are ok.

4. How did you figure out what surface to use?
Used floor function on x and z, then checked on which side of the line x+z=1 it was on.

4. How did you calculate the height from the surface?
Used the plane equation y=dot(((x0,y0,z0),normal)-x*normal.x-z*normal.z)/normal.y
